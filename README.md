# Object Detection Inference: _Visualized_

This repository offers a blog-style Streamlit application to help visualize the inference workflow of a single-stage object detector. Specifically, we see how a pre-trained [RetinaNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02002) model processes an image to quickly and accurately detect objects, while also exploring fundamental object detection concepts along the way.
