# Object Detection Inference: _Visualized_



![](images/collage.png)



This repository offers a blog-style Streamlit application to help visualize the inference workflow of a single-stage object detector. Specifically, we see how a [RetinaNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02002) architecture processes an image to quickly and accurately detect objects, while also exploring the following fundamental object detection concepts along the way:

- Multi-scale feature extraction with Feature Pyramid Networks (FPNs)
- Inline anchor box generation with Region Proposal Networks (RPNs)
- Detection post-processing with Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS)

Throughout the repo, we utilize a [PyTorch implementation of RetinaNet](https://github.com/pytorch/vision/blob/master/torchvision/models/detection/retinanet.py) that has been pre-trained on the [Common Objects in Context (COCO) 2017](https://cocodataset.org/#home) dataset.

## Deploying on CML

There are three ways to launch this project on CML:

1. **From Prototype Catalog** - Navigate to the Prototype Catalog on a CML workspace, select the "Object Detection Inference: _Visualized_" tile, click "Launch as Project", click "Configure Project"
2. **As ML Prototype** - In a CML workspace, click "New Project", add a Project Name, select "ML Prototype" as the Initial Setup option, copy in this repo URL, click "Create Project", click "Configure Project"
3. **Manual Setup** - In a CML workspace, click "New Project", add a Project Name, select "Git" as the Initial Setup option, copy in the repo URL, click "Create Project". Launch a Python 3 Workbench Session and run `!pip3 install -r requirements.txt` to install requirements. Then create a CML Application as described in the [CML documentation](https://docs.cloudera.com/machine-learning/1.1/applications/topics/ml-applications.html), using `app/app.py` as the launch script.



## Setup outside of CML

The code and applications within were developed against Python 3.8.6. To setup the application outside of a CML environment,  first create and activate a new virtual environment through your preferred means, then pip install dependencies from the requirements file:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, to start the application, run the following command from the root directory of the repo:

```
streamlit run app/app.py
```

Note - you may need to configure ports depending on where the application is launched from.
